# Proxy Contract System

## Project Description
Implement upgradeable contract patterns with proxies that allow smart contracts to be upgraded while maintaining their state and address. This system enables seamless contract evolution without disrupting user interactions or losing valuable on-chain data.

## Project Vision
To create a robust and secure proxy contract system that enables blockchain applications to evolve over time while maintaining backward compatibility and preserving user trust. Our vision is to eliminate the traditional limitation of immutable smart contracts by providing a safe upgrade mechanism that empowers developers to fix bugs, add features, and improve functionality without requiring users to migrate to new contract addresses.
